<h1>Snapdeal Clone</h1>

Snapdeal is an Indian online e-commerce website. People can search and find products of their choice and order them. The variety of products include clothing, accessories, kitchen-ware, jewellery etc.

In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of Snapdeal. It was a team effort of 5 members completed within a week.

We used Express for backend and ReactJs for frontend along with few other libraries to add functionality such as signup & login, and much more.
